        <h2>Niceware</h2>
        <p>
            Niceware words are chosen at random from a list of 65,536 English language words. Each word
            has ~16 bits of entropy. An 8 word random passphrase has 128 bits of entropy which
            is strong enough to use for cryptographic keys. In comparison, words chosen
            from a standard Diceware list with 7,776 words have ~12.92 bits of entropy per word
            and therefore require more words to achieve the same security level.
